  <!--
  This is an image of the opening quotation character for your language.
  The image is used as a watermark on blockquote elements.  There are a
  number of different quote characters used by various languages, so the
  image name is translatable.  The name of the icon should be of the form
  "watermark-blockquote-XXXX.png", where XXXX is the Unicode code point
  of the opening quote character.  For example, some languages use the
  double angle quotation mark.  Translators for these languages should
  use "watermark-blockquote-00AB.png".

  The image, however, is not automatically created.  Do not translate
  this to a value if there isn't a corresponding file in gnome-doc-utils,
  under the directory data/watermarks.

  Languages that use guillemets (angle quotation marks) should use either
  00AB or 00BB, depending on whether the opening quotation is the left
  guillemet or the right guillemet.  Languages that use inverted comma
  quotation marks should use 201C, 201D, or 201E.  Single quotation marks
  don't make very nice watermarks, so if you would normally open a quote
  with single quotation marks in your language, use the corresponding
  double quotation mark for the watermark image.

  Translators who have been around Gnome for a while should recognize
  this as nearly the same as the "yelp-watermark-blockquote-201C" string
  once found inside Yelp.  The watermark functionality has been moved to
  gnome-doc-utils.

  This is a format message used to format numbers for appendices.  Numbers

  This is a format message used to format numbers for table.  Numbers
  are used in labels, cross references, and any other place where the
  table might be referenced.  The number for a table includes the
  number for its parent element, if applicable.  For example, the number

  this table, 4 is referred to as the parent number, and 3 is referred
  to as the table digit.  This format message constructs a full number
