This is to help deal with bugs more efficiently. This means <application>Bug Buddy</application> has been substantially rewritten to deal with the bugzilla system. It looks very similar in appearance and structure, but be aware that it now talks to bugzillas. Reports will only go to the old debbugs system for GNOME if bugzilla doesn't have a category for the bug."
