================================================================================

We would love to have Greek numerals supported!

However, the current locale support in CSS3 [1] appears to be quite suboptimal
for Greek.  The Greek alphabetic numbering follows the legacy of Ancient Greek
which adds three letter-numbers [2]. Specifically, it introduces three letters
(for 6, 90, 900) that shift the letters to the right: 6, 90, 900 are represented
by ϛ (in modern Greek: στ), ϟ, ϡ

According to [1], CSS3 does not take into account any of those characters and
especially "στ".  Therefore, there is the issue of correctness for 6, 7, 8,
and so on.

In addition, CSS3 is not good with the capitalisation (changing case) of Greek
text, as there are specific rules that drop accents, and in some cases this
depends on the context (based on the word).

It appears that when CSS3 was being drafted, there was no feedback for Greek :(

Therefore, it would be better for Greek not to use alphabetic numerals through
CSS3 at this moment for issues of correctness.  For the record, I sent an e-mail
to this CSS3 working group in case it is possible to fix the missing letters.
Thanks for bringing the issue to my attention.
