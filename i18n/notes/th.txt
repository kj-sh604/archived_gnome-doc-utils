Subject: Thai Numbering in gnome-doc-utils
================================================================================

Hello,

I'm going to translate gnome-doc-utils into Thai and find two required
Thai numberings are missing. One is Thai alphabetical, and the other is
Thai decimal digits.

Thai alphabetical numbering is run with Thai consonants in the range:

  U+0E01 (THAI CHARACTER KO KAI)
    :
  U+0E2E (THAI CHARACTER HO NOKHUK)

with three characters skipped, namely:

  - U+0E03 (THAI CHARACTER KHO KHUAT)
  - U+0E05 (THAI CHARACTER KHO KHON)
  - U+0E06 (THAI CHARACTER KHO RAKHANG)

(i.e. the sequence is: U+0E01, U+0E02, U+0E04, U+0E07 .. U+0E2E)

This is mainly used for numbering appendixes in Thai documents,
and occasionally used in ordered lists.

Numbering with Thai decimal digits is less used in general, but exists
in most official or military documents. It just uses Thai digits in the
range (U+0E50..U+0E50) for 0..9 respectively.

I'm not sure about digits bahavior described by W3C's XSLT, nor what
have been done in gnome-doc-utils, but let me mention a common mistake
in some implementations: the assumed translation of digits. We would
need an explicit way to specify whether to use Thai digits in numbering,
rather than automatically translated.

Thank you for your attention. Any comment would be appreciated.
