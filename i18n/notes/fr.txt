 <vuntz> but it's in small capitals
 <vuntz> (and we use the roman digits in "regular" capitals for other things)
<shaunm> small capitals?
 <vuntz> yes. Let me find a link that explains it
 <vuntz> something like this:
	 http://docs.roxen.com/roxen/4.0/web_developer_manual/text/smallcaps.tag
 <vuntz> in fact, it exists in css:
	 http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_font_font-variant.asp
<shaunm> ah, that
<shaunm> ok, I can't add that this release cycle
<shaunm> but please file a bug about it
<shaunm> the solution will be to wrap the section.label translation with some
	 markup
<shaunm> <smallcaps><number/>.&#x2003;</smallcaps>
<shaunm> something like that, the syntax may differ
 <vuntz> ok
 <vuntz> I'll file a bug
 <vuntz> last question
 <vuntz> the worst
 <vuntz> for the quote format...
 <vuntz> when the quote is in another quote (that's the "inner" role, iirc),
	 there's a special case in french
 <vuntz> if the inner quote ends with the outer quote, then we have only one
	 quote at the end
 <vuntz> example:
 <vuntz> « I told you « don't say that. »
 <vuntz> I know, it's weird :-)
 <vuntz> that's not a huge problem, though
<shaunm> weird indeed
 <vuntz> we can accept to have two quotes at the end ;-)
 <vuntz> but it might be something that happens in other languages, so...
<shaunm> hmm
<shaunm> I think that can be addressed, with some thought
